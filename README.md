# TestForm

testForm - a project snippet using Nuxt 3 / TailwindCSS

Functionality

- If the form has been filled out, then the data is transferred to a third-party service via a POST request.
- If the response is successful, then the client is transferred to another page with the simple text “thank you for your order,” otherwise with the text “error.”
- Make a simple validation to ensure the number is correct, example: +7(777)777-77-77.
- Make it impossible for one person to send data a second time.
